                <p>The snow had melted away and you could see that through the windows,so you rolled your bed away and locked
            up your belongings.</p><p>The room was filled with men and smelled like tobacco and gin.You still wondered how you survived each day with a room full of men.
            Men from all over the world,men like you.</p><p>You knew that some had lost their way and that no redemption was on the way.
            You understood it all;and your sanity was the most important,if you must return home.</p>
                <p>You dreamt of home and how far it has become, across several oceans and lands, a journey
                that took two years of your life.You walked into the park,and you could feel the sun run rays in the cold afternoon,it shone brightly.it was like
                a blessing.So peaceful in your face,as you dragged the cigarette and felt at peace within yourself.</p><p>Down in the valley,
                the pretty girls played basketball in their heavy winter clothes.You stared at them, and for a second thought,you walked towards them.
                'Hey wanna join?' one of them asked you;in a clear English accent and threw the ball at you;you held it in your palm,bounced it once,stamped
                and aimed at the basket.</p><p>You made a three point on first throw.They were really impressed by your skills.You felt like a champion.</p>
                <p>'Nice shot',the blond girl said.You smiled.</p>
                <p>'Where are you from?'the first girl asked you.They threw the ball back at you.
                'Nigeria',you said smiling,bouncing the ball around and going for your second aim.The spanish girl sitting on the bench
                finished tying her shoe lace and ran to block you.You ducked like a pro and made another shot.</p>
                <p>'Aha,Nigeria,yea I have a colleague from Nigeria,you might want to meet him...I work with UNICEF
                here in Geneva, my name is Gina,' the first girl said to you with a smile on her face.</p>
                <p>'Sam',you said smiling back at her</p>
                <p>'And these are my friends...'she pointed at the Spanish girl first.</p>
                <p>'Shina',the spanish girl said smiling at you.</p>
                <p>'Natasha',She said and shook your hands.</p> 
                <p>You know what, Geneva, it's the international city,you know the whole world live here and is easy to communicate and get along with anyone.You enjoyed that,you are happy you
                came here after all,but then you remembered your condition and that happiness melted like ice.You wished it wasn't that bad,</p>
                <p>You wanted everything to work out on its own,but you are the boxer,you the master of patience.You beleive it.
                You know that one day you will ba able to park your pathfinder by the basket ball court,play and probably
                drop the girls off.You imagined it.You wanted that life,you think you have come a long way and giving up wasn't part of your plan now.
                Like the priest used to say back home, 'the goodness of God comes slowly.'You believed that more than any other person.</p>
                <p>You are tall enough to slam the ball in the basket,so to impress the girls you made a rush for it.Your heavy biceps and strength helped
                grip the basket rim,you slammed the ball into it.They clapped for you;they were really impressed by your skills.</p>
                <p>'Hey: it's really nice to meet you,may I ask what you are doing in Geneva?'Gina asked.</p>
                <p>That's one question you don't answer proudly.You drag your foot with it.You don't easily respond.</p>
                <p>But of what use is keeping it to yourself?</p><strong>[...To be continued..]</strong>
